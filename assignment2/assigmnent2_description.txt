In this assignment, we were asked to implement 4 different filters: no filter, greyscale, contrast, gaussian, and edge detection.
By pressing the number 0, the program will display the image with no filter.
By pressing the number 1, the program will display the image with a greyscale filter.
By pressing the number 2, the program will display the image with a contrast filter.
By pressing the number 3, the program will display the image with a gaussian blur filter.
By pressing the number 4, the program will display the image with an edge detection filter.
By pressing any other key not stated above will result in the program displaying the original image(with no filter).
