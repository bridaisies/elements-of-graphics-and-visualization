Description for a3_novelvisualization.pde:

Processing software must be installed for program to open and work.
When run, a display of words will be shown, where these words being one of three colors:  red, green, or beige.
	-words will be displayed as red when that word has less than or equal to 6 letters.
	-words will be displayed as green when that word has the greater than 6 letters and less than 9 letters
	-all other words will be displayed as beige
By pressing a mouse key it will display another set of randomly selected words, with their corresponding colors.
These colors were chosen out of personal preference, I thought that they looked nice together.
Font size was chosen due to it being a good readable size, without being too large or small.
Time New Roman was chosen as itâ€™s an easy and simple to read font.



Description for a3_wordfrequency.pde and homersodyssey_wordcloud.png: 

The world cloud image generated (homersodyssey_wordcloud.png) is meant to look like a castle against the sky as the book is about a king. 

For a3_wordfrequency.pde, I decided to make a bar graph in order to represent word frequency, the height of each bar represents the amount of words for that frequency and frequency increases by 1 as you go left to right. I also adjusted the bar sizes to be relative to each other in order to show a comparison between the word frequencies and how drastically they change.
